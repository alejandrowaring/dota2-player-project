# dota2-player-project

## Project Proposal

This project will allow an end user to enter their Steam ID and have the web page return statistics on their past 100 ranked matches (as a default), and analyize the game to find trends in their behaviour to provide insights on how the user can improve their game play. The following statistics will be returned to the user:
 - Overall Win/Loss Rate
 - Recent Win/Loss Rate
 - Most successful Heros
 -
